## Project Description:
(In this project we learned about how VCS's are useful and the basics of Git.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version Control Systems were made to fix the problem of losing files. VCS's record changes to files every step of the way.)
2. (Git thinks differently than other VCS's. Git stores and saves your files like a stream of snapshots, instead of file-based changes.)
3. (Git has three states and sections to store files that make it easily accessible to work on offline.)
4. (There are different ways to install Git for different systems and preferences of installation.)
5. (It is important and easy to set up your Git environment according to your prefences.)
