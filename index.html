            <p class="lead">VCS’s (Version Control Systems) were created to fix the problem of losing files from your previous work on projects for things like web design. What VCS’s specifically do is record changes made to a file, or clusters of files, every step of the way. This is convenient for web designers because it allows you to look back at your previous work to compare and learn from your previous work. The three types of VCS’s are Local, Centralized, and Distributed Version Control Systems. The Local Version Control System that offers a simple that keep all changes under one revision control. Centralized Version Control Systems allow for multiple devices to work on one single server at once. Lastly, the Distributed Version Control System provides clones of each version incase the server dies, making up for what is usually a problem in Centralized Version Control Systems.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different than most VCS’s. What makes Git special is the way it thinks differently than other VCS’s. Instead of storing information of file-based changes, Git takes snapshots of your work every step of the way like a stream of snapshots, and allows you to have your entire project’s history on one local disk. It also allows for you to be able to work if you are offline and upload once you are back online. It also is always adding data, it makes it easy to ‘undo’ actions you’ve made, which takes a lot of stress off when creating projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the main parts of Git is learning the way the files are stored in it’s three main states. The three main states are the committed, modified, and staged states. The Modified State means that the file is still in the process of being worked on and changed, and you do not want to commit to the database yet. Committed means that the file has “committed” to the database and is safe and stored. Staged means that the file has been marked as current and is ready to move on to its next snapshot. The three main sections of git are the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The directory is where the metadata is stored, the working tree is where one version is checked out, and the staging area is where information is stored about the user’s next commit. These states and sections are what make Git run different and more smoothly than other VCS’s.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to install Git you have to make it available for your computer and it can be installed as a package, or you can download the source code and compile it yourself. To install on Linux you can use the code “$ sudo yum install git-all” on Fedora, or “$ sudo apt-get install git-all” on a Debian based distribution. The easiest way to install on Mac is installing the Xcode Command Line tools. To install on Windows to get the most official build is through the Git website, and it will download automatically. And finally, to install Git from the source you need to already have the libraries Git depends on, and enable the EPEL repository to download it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Once you have downloaded Git, you want to customize your environment. Git comes with a tool called “git config” that lets you control and make your environment your own and are stored in three different areas. You first need to customize your identity by setting up your name and email address with the GUI tools made to help you. Next you need to set up your editor that is specific for your system like Emacs. You also need to check your settings. You can do this by using the “git config --list” command to find and list all of your current settings. </p>
